# The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
# 1*1 + 2*2 + ... + 10*10 = 385
# The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
# (1 + 2 + ... + 10)*(1 + 2 + ... + 10) = 55*55 = 3025
# Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the
#  first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

# Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the
#  first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
