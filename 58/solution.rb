# It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right
#  diagonal, but what is more interesting is that 8 out of the 13 numbers
#  lying along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of 8/13 â‰ˆ 62%.

# If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square
#  spiral with side length 9 will be formed. If this process is continued,
#  what is the side length of the square spiral for which the ratio of
#  primes along both diagonals first falls below 10%?
# Time to complete: 30 minutes
